Firing is as important as hiring. Seriously. We're not Kidding.

Every idea starts with a problem. Ours was simple - hiring was getting too much importance. We couldn't take it anymore. Hence, Firee was born with one very simple goal:

Help managers FIRE better

The concept of Firee was inspired on 12 December 2015 at API Hackday. However, it was not the first idea we had for the day. We started with improving customer care, went on the help you get the most food for the least money. Everything we came up with was just too mainstream. We hate cliches, and that is the reason Firee is growing at a very fast pace and is used by 900+ companies to meet their current firing needs (Do we sound like we're joking?).

Along with many other peaks Firee has scaled, Firee proudly wears the tag of "Fastest from Shit-to-Shittier" in recruitment space, with its recent Series-NULL funding on feburary 30, 2015.

###The Idea

When you enter the twitter handle of the person you need to fire. We fetch the person's last 10 tweets, pass them through the HP sentiment analysis API and tell you if the person is having a good day or a bad day. If he's already having a bad day you don't want to fire him, right?

Then, you can initiate a call to the person (using the exotel API) to inform him/her about the firing.
